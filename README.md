This is an iterative implementation of Heap's Algorithm

See the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm) for more info

I use global variables so that the output can be passed to a return statment.

change the "#define JEB" value and compile to modify list length (Be wary of factorials that exceed max int)
